              <p class="about"> 
                MyFlix Angular is a client-side application built with Angular, 
                and designed for user to access details of movies. The application 
                includes user authentication and profile management page and allowing 
                users to make a list of their favourite movies. 

            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I developed an understanding of how to use Angular and build an app with it, 
                including TypeScript. I also enhanced my UI skills and understanding by 
                implementing Angular Material, which has build in tools and styles for Angular, 
                to keep a consistency in the app user-ability.

                <li>Angular: Framework that built this application</li>
                <li>Angular Material: implemented UI features from Angular Materials collection such 
                    as buttons, grids, form and dialog elements to build a neat and professional fun 
                    looking interface. </li>

                <li>JSDoc & TypeDoc: I implemented this to show commenting and documentation on the app.</li>
                <li>Trello: I used this Kansan tool to keep on track with the tasks required for this app- in order to share my collaboration with others.
