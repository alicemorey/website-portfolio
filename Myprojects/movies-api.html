          <p class="about"> 
            Pokedex is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that
             loads data from an external API and enables the users to see the details of
              each Pokemon. It provides a simple user friendly single page web application , 
              users can hover over the buttons and the names of the Pokemon appear, 
              additionally when each button is clicked more details like height and a picture 
              of each Pokemon are revealed in a modal.
              <br>
            Developing this application enhanced by skills in working with JavaScript for 
            the first time, it also allowed me to become familiar with working with APIs, 
            handling asynchronous operations and managing dynamic data. 
            I learned how to implement modals to display detailed information, 
            also layouts with Bootstrap. 
            I also installed Linter in my Visual Code program to help me with optimising 
            my code layout and keeping it well formatted, as well as ESLint & Prettier.
