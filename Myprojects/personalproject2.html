          <p class="about"> 
            KunstKombüse is a website for a Berlin-based art Intiative.

             to more information about the project that took place in Bad Segeberg, near Hamburg. 
             This website provies information about the timetable of performances and workshops that took 
             place, as well as inforamton on the artists, musicians and creatives that took part.
          </p>
          <p class="about"> 
            Whilst building this website I learned alot of new designing formats and I also had a chance to understand 
            what it is like working with a team of people and their needs- specifically whilst having to produce a web application, working on day to day 
            deadlines and updates that needed to be executed.
            There was also alot of communciation needed between the team to share data, images and concepts, that I had to try to formulate into the web application.
