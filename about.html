            Hi, I’m Alice, a web developer from London, based in Berlin. 
            <br>
            I’m passionate about creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly code!
            This portfolio showcases the projects I’m currently working on as I begin my career. 
            I’m eager to connect, grow, and learn from others as I advance in the field.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to web development, I have a strong background in the arts and creative industries, 
            with experience in developing concepts, projects, and exhibitions in collaborative environments.
            Please get in touch if you’d like to work together!
