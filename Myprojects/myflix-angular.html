<h1 class="heading">Project Description</h1>
<p class="about"> The MyFlix Angular Client is a front-end app built with Angular, 
    made for users to browse a catalog of movies, directors, and genres. 
    It has features like user login, profile management, and lets users save their favorite movies. 
    This project shows my ability to create a responsive single-page app using Angular and includes 
    clear documentation to help other developers understand and contribute.
    <br>
    While working on MyFlix, I improved my knowledge of Angularâ€™s component-based structure 
    and learned how to manage state and data using Angular services. I also gained experience 
    in building user-friendly, responsive designs with Angular Material, ensuring the app looks 
    consistent and appealing. Additionally, I learned how to handle navigation within the app 
    for smooth switching between pages. 
    By connecting with the MyFlix REST API, I improved my skills in fetching and processing data. 
    I also learned how to document and share my work using tools like Trello, TypeDoc, and JSDoc for better collaboration.
