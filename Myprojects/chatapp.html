                A React Native mobile chat application for communication between 
                users. Allows the user to exchange texts , share images and current 
                location.
                The app is built using React Native, 
                Expo and Google Firestore Database. 
                The app ensures fluid communication with online and offline options. 
                The user can customise their experience by entering their name 
                and choosing a background colour for their chat screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learnt about React Native, Android Studio and Expo, 
                using this to test and develop the app. I also development my 
                understanding of integrating Firebase for authentication and 
                real time data storage. I then implement the Gifted Chat library 
                with helped create an interactive chat interface. I was also able 
                to implement the camera function and image sharing and then sharing
                a location map.
